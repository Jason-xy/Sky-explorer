There are two example programs here. Both programs require OpenCV to be installed with GStreamer support enabled.
Both of these examples were last tested with L4T 31.0.2, OpenCV 3.4.3

The first is a simple C++ program to view the onboard camera feed from the Jetson Dev Kit.

To compile gstreamer_view.cpp:

$ g++ -o gstreamer_view -Wall -std=c++11 gstreamer_view.cpp $(pkg-config --libs opencv)


to run the program:

$ ./gstreamer_view

The second is a Python program that reads the onboard camera feed from the Jetson Dev Kit and does Canny Edge Detection.

To run the Canny detection demo (Python 2.7):

$ python cannyDetection.py

With Python 3.3:

$ python3 cannyDetection.py

With the Canny detection demo, use the less than (<) and greater than (>) to adjust the edge detection parameters.

## Notes

1. The gstreamer_view example is from Peter Moran:
   https://gist.github.com/peter-moran/742998d893cd013edf6d0c86cc86ff7f
   Note that the nvvidconv flip-method was changed to 0. Earlier versions of L4T used a flip method of 2.

2. For the Python examples, you will need to have the appropriate librariers installed. From the buildOpenCV scripts:

####     Python 2.7
    $ sudo apt-get install -y python-dev python-numpy python-py python-pytest
####     Python 3.5
    $ sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-numpy python3-py python3-pytest
