# buildOpenCVXavier
Build and install OpenCV for the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier

These scripts build OpenCV version 3.4 for the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit. 

OpenCV is a rich environment which can be configured in many different ways. You should configure OpenCV for your needs, by modifying the build file "buildOpenCV.sh". Note that selecting different options in OpenCV may also have additional library requirements which are not included in these scripts. Please read the notes below for other important points before installing.

The buildOpenCV script has two optional command line parameters:

<ul>
<li>-s | --sourcedir   Directory in which to place the opencv sources (default $HOME)</li>
<li>-i | --installdir  Directory in which to install opencv libraries (default /usr/local)</li>
</ul>

To run the the build file:

$ ./buildOpenCV.sh -s &lt;file directory&gt;

This example will build OpenCV in the given file directory and install OpenCV in the /usr/local directory.

The folder ~/opencv and (optional) ~/opencv_extras contain the source, build and extra data files. If you wish to remove them after installation, a convenience script is provided:

$ ./removeOpenCVSources.sh -d &lt;file directory&gt;

where the &lt;file directory&gt; contains the OpenCV source.

The folder ~/opencv and ~/opencv_extras contain the source, build and extra data files. If you wish to remove them after installation, a convenience script is provided:

$ ./removeOpenCVSources.sh

<h3>Packaging</h3>
An alternative build script, buildAndPackageOpenCV.sh , will build the OpenCV package as described above and the build .deb files using the standard OpenCV mechanism defined using the CPACK_BINARY_DEB=ON in the OpenCV Make file. See the script.

The buildAndPackageOpenCV script has two optional command line parameters:

<ul>
<li>-s | --sourcedir   Directory in which to place the opencv sources (default $HOME)</li>
<li>-i | --installdir  Directory in which to install opencv libraries (default /usr/local)</li>
</ul>

To run the the build file:

$ ./buildAndPackageOpenCV.sh -s &lt;file directory&gt;

This example will build OpenCV in the given file directory and install OpenCV in the /usr/local directory.

The corresponding .deb files will be in the &lt;file directory&gt;/opencv/build directory in .deb file and compressed forms. 

<h4>Installing .deb files</h4>

To install .deb files:

Switch to the directory where the .deb files are located. Then:

<blockquote>
$ sudo dpkg -i OpenCV-&lt;OpenCV Version info&gt;-aarch64-libs.deb

<em>For example: $ sudo dpkg -i OpenCV-3.4.1-1-g75a2577-aarch64-libs.deb</em> 

$ sudo apt-get install -f

$ sudo dpkg -i OpenCV-&lt;OpenCV Version info&gt;-aarch64-dev.deb 

$ sudo dpkg -i OpenCV-&lt;OpenCV Version info&gt;-aarch64-python.deb </blockquote>

The libraries will be installed in /usr/lib

Binaries are in /usr/bin

opencv.pc is in /usr/lib/pkgconfig

<strong>Package Notes: </strong>
<ul><li>The build process default installation is in /usr/local
Note that the .deb file install into /usr</li>
<li>After installation, the dpkg/apt name does not include version information, e.g. the name is opencv-libs</li>
</ul>

## Notes
There may be issues if different version of OpenCV are installed. JetPack normally installs OpenCV in the /usr folder. You will need to consider if this is appropriate for your application. It is important to realize that many packages may rely on OpenCV. The standard installation by JetPack places the OpenCV libraries in the /usr directory. 

You may consider removing OpenCV installed by JetPack before performing this script installation:

$ sudo apt-get purge libopencv*

With this script release, the script now installs OpenCV in /usr/local. Earlier versions of this script installed in /usr. You may have to set your include and libraries and/or PYTHONPATH to point to the new version. See the Examples folder. Alternatively, you may want to change the script to install into the /usr directory.

The Jetson is an aarch64 machine, which means that the OpenCV configuration variable ENABLE_NEON is ignored. The compiler includes NEON support for all machines with aarch64 architecture.

These scripts rely on OpenCV finding the correct CUDA version, instead of setting it manually.

Special thanks to Daniel (Github user @dkoguciuk) for script cleanup.
